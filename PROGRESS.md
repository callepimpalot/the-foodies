# 🍏 Project Roadmap: The Foodies Family Orchestrator

## 🚨 Critical Bugs & Repairs (High Priority)
- [ ] **Recipe Library Restoration:** Investigate why the Recipes tab is currently empty and restore the connection to the existing recipe data.
- [ ] **Planning Tab Overhaul:** Complete redesign required to fix alignment, scaling, and visual "chaos".


## 🏃 Current Sprint (Active Polish)

## 🛠 Product Backlog (Open Tasks)

### 🎨 Visual & UI Upgrades
- [ ] **Pantry Card Icon:** Replace the "childish" cardboard box emoji with a professional, Zinc-style icon.
- [ ] **Global Style Alignment:** Re-evaluate app-wide fonts and colors to match the superior aesthetic found in the Recipes tab.
- [ ] **Thumb-Friendly Targets:** Optimize all buttons in "Active Shopping" and "Cook" modes for one-handed thumb use.
- [ ] **Typography Polish:** Apply `tracking-tight` and `font-bold` to Hero titles (e.g., Margherita Pizza).
- [ ] **Carousel Indicators:** Add navigation dots below the 24H meal carousel.
- [ ] **Smart Overlays:** Ensure date badges ("Tomorrow", "Feb 12") appear on all carousel cards.

### 🧠 New Features & Logic
- [ ] **Profile Depth:** Surface and make editable the "hidden" background configurations (settings/user data) when clicking the user icon.
- [ ] **Recipe Personalization:** Enable the ability to "fork" recipes to save customized versions based on allergies or personal preferences.
- [ ] **Leftover Management:** Build logic to tag meals as "Generating Leftovers" so they appear as selectable "Instant Meal" options for later in the week.
- [ ] **Shopping Consolidation Engine:** Create a workflow to "Lock" planned meals and generate a static shopping snapshot.
- [ ] **Shopping Intelligence Card:** Design a pop-up summarizing the list source (Meals included, person count, and last pantry check date).
- [ ] **Family Settings:** Create a simple input/onboarding to save the `familyName` to state.
- [ ] **Smart Pantry Categories:** Logic to group items by type (Produce, Dairy, etc.).

## ❄️ Utility & "Next Level" UX (Icebox)
- [ ] **Mockup Subscribe button:** Design the UI for creator subscriptions.
- [ ] **Research POD API:** Investigate print-on-demand services for cookbooks.
- [ ] **Design Post-Cook share card:** Create the social share asset for 'Strava for Food'.
- [ ] **Cook Now Mode:** Dedicated full-screen recipe view with large, high-readability text.
- [ ] **Screen Wake Lock (Cook & Shop):** Implement a "Keep Screen On" toggle using the Wake Lock API for both Active Shopping and Cook modes.
- [ ] **AI Recipe Doctor:** Integrate a chat API to modify and update recipe data in real-time through conversation.
- [ ] **AI Smart Planner:** Use AI to auto-populate weekly meals based on specific constraints (e.g., "<30 mins cook time, high protein").
- [ ] **Recipe Publishing:** Add functionality for users to publish their customized personal recipes.
- [ ] "Empty State" design for the Pantry (Notion-style minimalism).
- [ ] Hardware-accelerated transitions for "Pantry Detail" slide-up views.
