# Design Assets & Cues

This directory is the central hub for all visual and UX-related assets.

## Structure
- `/screenshots`: Dumps of current UI for feedback or reference.
- `/inspiration`: Visual cues, mood boards, and references from other apps.
- `/wireframes`: Early stage layouts and UX flows.

## Instructions for Lead Designer
1. Use this folder to share visual progress with the CEO.
2. Maintain clear naming conventions for screenshots (e.g., `2024-02-07-pantry-swipe-v1.png`).
